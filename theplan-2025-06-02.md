# Migration Completion Plan (2025-06-02)

This document lists the outstanding tasks needed to finish porting the legacy Fever PHP project to the new Next.js codebase.

## Missing Features

1. **Fever API Compatibility**
   - Implement the `/api/fever` route in Next.js to accept authentication tokens and respond with the same JSON structure as the legacy Fever API.
   - Support feed listing, group management, item retrieval, and mark-as-read actions.
   - Ensure third-party clients can connect to the new backend without changes.

2. **Feedlet Bookmarklet**
   - Recreate the bookmarklet that lets users quickly subscribe to a feed from any page.
   - Provide a simple UI to install or copy the bookmarklet in the Next.js front end.
   - Handle authentication so the bookmarklet can add feeds for logged-in users.

3. **Mobile Interface**
   - Build dedicated mobile views similar to the original PHP `mobile` directory.
   - Use responsive React components or a lightweight PWA approach for offline support.
   - Preserve features like swipe navigation and compact feed list layout.

4. **Update and Maintenance Scripts**
   - Replace the disabled PHP `update.php` mechanism with a Node-based script or CLI command.
   - Include database migrations and upgrade helpers to ease future releases.
   - Document how to run updates in the README.

5. **Miscellaneous Enhancements**
   - Port remaining helper scripts (e.g., favicon caching) that are still PHP-only.
   - Review the legacy `extras` folder for any functionality not yet migrated.
   - Clean up deprecated files once the new implementations are verified.

## Next Steps

- Prioritize the Fever API implementation so client apps can interact with the new backend.
- After the API is functional, tackle the bookmarklet and mobile interface concurrently.
- Plan a beta release once these features are complete and the new update script has been tested.
